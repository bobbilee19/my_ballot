		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
		<p>We know that voting can be overwhelming--even if you know what you're doing, but especially if you're newly registered. MyBallot, created by four Starter League students passionate about civic engagement, aims to assist first-time and inexperienced voters, but it's a great tool for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the booth on election day. Every visitor can enter a ZIP code to find out who will be on his or her ballot, including local and judicial races. Registered users can take notes and save their choices to create a custom voting guide. </p>
